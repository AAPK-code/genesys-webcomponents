## Adding Components

### Use Existing Components If Possible
Existing components should be used whenever possible. You can check the
[Genesys UX Guidelines](https://intranet.genesys.com/display/UXT/Genesys+UX+Guidelines+3.0)
to find the component which matches your need.

### Adding New Components
If you really need to create a new component, then you should work with the UX
team to create a new component that can be added to the UX Guidelines.


## Code Quality
Common UI components should be held to a high standard of quality, preferring
TypeScript where possible over JavaScript and should have a strong suite of
tests.

### Documentation
Each Common UI Component should have thourough Storybook documentation with
clear examples of its usage and feature.

### Testing
All components should be thouroughly unit tested.


## Accessibility and Localization
All components should be localizable and designed/implemented with
accessibility in mind. You can look at the
[Genesys Accessibility Best Practices](https://intranet.genesys.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=RDA&title=Accessibility)
for more information.


## Submission Guidelines

All submissions should be reviewed by at least 1 Common UI team member from each
of Pure Cloud, Pure Connect, and Pure Engage.
